# Home Assistant Add-on: Tesla Local Commands

Send commands via MQTT to a Tesla car using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)


This Addon is a package of iainbullock's https://github.com/iainbullock/tesla_ble_mqtt_docker
It runs the official Tesla Vehicle SDK commands via BLE to activate various entities in your Tesla.
This is to bypass the current Fleet API rate limitation as it does not rely on the API.

This package contains:
- All the code generated by iainbullock repackaged as a HA addon
- A `standalone` folder which contains a single script to run the BLE service on a separate machine
